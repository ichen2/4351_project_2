testscript, geralds_output.txt, and our_output.txt are all files we used to test our parser.
testscript runs the test cases and outupts them to our_output, so that we can compare them with geralds_output.

Everything seems to work right.  We created some helper functions to make everything more readable.
To avoid conflicts, we made sure there was no left recursion or common left factors.
